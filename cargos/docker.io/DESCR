Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any
application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that
will run virtually anywhere.

Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently
on and between virtually any server. The same container that a developer
builds and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production, on VMs,
bare-metal servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or
combinations of the above.
