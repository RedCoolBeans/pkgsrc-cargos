Machine lets you create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and
inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then
configures the Docker client to talk to them.

Once your Docker host has been created, it then has a number of commands for
managing them:

    - Starting, stopping, restarting
    - Upgrading Docker
    - Configuring the Docker client to talk to your host
