builtin krb5-config in platforms such as solaris do not support
the gssapi option, and need an explicit -lgss

diff: invalid option -- 'I'
BusyBox v1.23.2 (2015-08-17 15:41:01 CEST) multi-call binary.

Usage: diff [-abBdiNqrTstw] [-L LABEL] [-S FILE] [-U LINES] FILE1 FILE2

Compare files line by line and output the differences between them.
This implementation supports unified diffs only.

	-a	Treat all files as text
	-b	Ignore changes in the amount of whitespace
	-B	Ignore changes whose lines are all blank
	-d	Try hard to find a smaller set of changes
	-i	Ignore case differences
	-L	Use LABEL instead of the filename in the unified header
	-N	Treat absent files as empty
	-q	Output only whether files differ
	-r	Recurse
	-S	Start with FILE when comparing directories
	-T	Make tabs line up by prefixing a tab when necessary
	-s	Report when two files are the same
	-t	Expand tabs to spaces in output
	-U	Output LINES lines of context
	-w	Ignore all whitespace
